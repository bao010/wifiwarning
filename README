This is WiFi Warning.
WiFi Warning is an Android application that notifies users of Android based
devices when the WiFi is enabled but not connected.

What the app should do when you select the warning notification is configurable,
as is whether the notification should stay when you clear your notifications.

Requires Android 2.3 or higher.

This project is heavily inspired by Wifi Status by Andrew Schwimmer (available
on the Android Market,
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.schwimmer.android.wifistatus), and was
developed only because that application stopped working in Android 4.0 (Ice
Cream Sandwich).
