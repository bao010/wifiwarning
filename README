This is WiFi Warning.
WiFi Warning is an Android application that notifies users of Android based
devices when the WiFi is enabled but not connected.

Requires Android 3.0 or higher.

This project is heavily inspired by WifiStatus by Andrew Schwimmer (available
on the Android Market), and was developed only because that application stopped
working in Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).
